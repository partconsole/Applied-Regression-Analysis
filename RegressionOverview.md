Description: Intermediate course in applied statistics covering simple linear regression, multiple linear
regression (with both quantitative and categorical predictors), and logistic regression. Emphasis is on model fitting,
diagnostics, inference, and interpretation, using statistical software in addition to the written communication of
statistical findings.

Objectives:
• Appropriately clean and prepare data for analysis
• Describe (in writing) the data cleaning and preparation process used in an analysis
• Create and interpret the appropriate numerical and graphical summaries to describe data
• Succinctly describe a data set in writing
• Set-up and interpret a simple linear regression model in context
• Obtain and interpret parameter estimates for a simple linear regression analysis
• Evaluate model assumptions for a simple linear regression analysis
• Set-up and interpret a multiple linear regression model in context
• Obtain and interpret parameter estimates for a multiple linear regression analysis
• Use model diagnostics to assess model assumptions in a multiple linear regression analysis
• Use model diagnostics to evaluate the presence of outliers and influential observations in a multiple linear
regression analysis
• Apply appropriate remedial measures when model assumptions are violated and/or outliers and influential
observations are present
• Use appropriate tools to select variables to include in a multiple linear regression analysis
• Use appropriate tools to select among competing models in a multiple linear regression analysis
• Explain how logistic regression differs from linear regression
• Set-up and interpret a logistic regression model in context
• Obtain and interpret parameter estimates for a logistic regression analysis
